### Hi there 👋
### I'm Tino, currently working as a SRE in a 24x7 NOC serving millions of gamers around the world ⚡
 
  🏔I like hardcore MTB trails, kick-ass BBQs, cooking all sorts of food, and noisy servers 😄<br>
  🔭 I’m currently working alongside an awesome team of SysAdmins, DevOps lizards and Network overlords... I guess. <br>
  👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything Operations-side! 4 Monitoring stacks, Overcomplicated CI/CDs, 99.99999% req. uptime scenarios, hell is paid well! <br>
  🤔 I’m looking for help with ... probably something to take the stress off. <br>
  💬 Ask me about why a monitoring stack should be monitored ... and what monitors the other stack then?! <br>
  📫 How to reach me: email me at inmate@187.ro
